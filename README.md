# Global Land Analysis - An SQL Report

## Introduction
This is an SQL project on global land analysis of an dummy datasets called **Lands**.
The project is to provide insight in to how land and forest has evolved over time.

**_Disclaimer_**: _All datasets and reports do not represent any country, region, or lands but are just a dummy dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of SQL in data analysis._

## Problem statement
1.What are the total number of countries involved in deforestation?

2.Show the income groups of countries having total area ranging from 75,000 to 150,000 square meter?

3.Calculate average area in square miles for countries in the 'upper middle income region'. Compare the result with the rest of the income categories.

4.Determine the total forest area in square km for countries in the 'high income' group. Compare result with the rest of the income categories.

5.Show countries from each region(continent) having the highest total forest areas.
