# Global Land Analysis - An SQL Report

## Introduction
This SQL project focuses on analyzing global land data from a fictional dataset named **Lands**.
The objective is to gain insights into the historical evolution of land and forest coverage worldwide.

**_Disclaimer_**:_The datasets and reports provided in this repository are purely fictitious and do not correspond to any real countries, regions, or land areas. They have been created solely for the purpose of demonstrating the capabilities of SQL in data analysis_.
## Problem statement
1.What are the total number of countries involved in deforestation?

2.Show the income groups of countries having total area ranging from 75,000 to 150,000 square meter?

3.Calculate average area in square miles for countries in the 'upper middle income region'. Compare the result with the rest of the income categories.

4.Determine the total forest area in square km for countries in the 'high income' group. Compare result with the rest of the income categories.

5.Show countries from each region(continent) having the highest total forest areas.
